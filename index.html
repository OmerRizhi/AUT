    <h2>Group Your Items</h2>
    <p>
        <br>You’ll now see the list of answers you wrote earlier. Group them into clusters according to the themes or connections you had in mind.
        <br>
        <br>How to group items:
        <br>• Click the first item in the cluster, then click the last item in the cluster — all items between will be grouped together.
        <br>• You can only group items that are adjacent to each other in the list.
        <br>• If an item should be in a group by itself, click it twice.
        <br>• To ungroup a cluster and regroup it differently, click any item within that group — the grouping will then be reset.
        <br>
        <br>You can make as many groups as you like. There are no right or wrong answers.
        <br>
        <br>When you’re done, click <strong>Submit</strong>.
